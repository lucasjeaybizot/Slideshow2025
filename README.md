# The Time Course of Neural Activity Predictive of Impending Movement
 This repository contains the code used in the study "The Time Course of Neural Activity Predictive of Impending Movement".
## Overview
 This repository contains the code necessary to generate the figures of the preprint https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ghs95. Data for that goes along with this code is available at https://osf.io/wm95q/ (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/WM95Q).<br><br>
 For all components to run you should have MATLAB installed, Python 3 and the software singularity (version 3.4.1).<br>
 For all components to run, first you need to download, unzip and merge into the repository and into their respective folders all the data from OSF (folders: data, data_ml, data_cubes and code_ml).<br>
 For all components to run, first you need to create the following folder: data_steps.<br><br>
 


## Generate figures

## Preprocess EEG data

## Run Haar-AdaBoost
Place data_cubes in the correct subject folders
Get_EDT_single.py
